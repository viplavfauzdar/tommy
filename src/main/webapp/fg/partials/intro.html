            <p>Finance Georgia gives you the exclusive ability to invest in companies before they go public.</p> <p>
            <p>
                Called “an E-Trade for Georgia Companies,” Finance Georgia allows you to buy shares in high-growth companies before Venture Capitalists, Private Equity firms, or Silicon Valley has the chance. </p>

            <h2>Our aim is simple.</h2>

            <p>For years, pre-IPO offers were available only to the likes of Warren Buffett and Mark Cuban. Finance Georgia invites you to join the first marketplace that allows Georgia investors to buy shares in high-growth Georgia companies.</p><p> 

                This is your chance to invest in the next Google, Facebook, or bio-tech invention, before it hits Wall-Street.</p>
