                                <p>Are they giving you priority access to their best deals and pre-IPO’s? 
                                <p>Are their research and recommendations impartial? 
                                <p>Can you invest as little as $500 with no additional commission?  
                                <p>With Finance Georgia, you can do all of these things, while helping to grow the economy of Georgia.

                        <p><i><b>First:</b></i> Through relationships with universities, chambers of commerce, start-up incubators, accelerators, and our wide network of business leaders, Finance Georgia finds only the best investment opportunities to list. 
                        <p><i><b>Second:</b></i> We do an internal due diligence. But to us that is not enough. There are fields that we are not as knowledgeable in. We may know finance and technology, but we are not experts in agriculture, military, health care, sports, etc. However our Leadership Council is.  
                        <p><i><b>Third:</b></i> The Finance Georgia Leadership council includes some of the top experts in the state across a variety of industries and areas. They assist us in helping select the top companies that are made available on Finance Georgia. Thus, there are multiple levels of research and approval before any company or charity is made public.

                        <br><p>No longer do you need to be a wealthy investor or one with connections to get in on the ground floor of some of the top start-ups.

                        <p>This takes money out of our local economy, and leads to some of our best innovators leaving the state. Think globally invest locally.</p>
                        <p>Finance Georgia works with existing Georgia angel and venture capital investors, to curate and maintain positive investment opportunities across all spectrums of financial institutions. Our goal is to create a free-market that benefits fundraising companies, existing institutional investors, and Georgia resident investors. </p>

                        <p>While there are never guarantees of an investment or a company’s success anywhere in the world, we hope that the investment opportunities offered by Finance Georgia continue to sow significant financial gains.  </p>
                        <p>But Finance Georgia isn’t just all about the money- we are about building economically viable communities. In this mission, we also allow and encourage you to donate to community based charitable causes, which have gone through our same vigorous selection process. (By the way, charitable projects on our platform receive 100% of the money they raise- we don’t earn a dime… we just believe that our technology should also be used to give back).</p>
